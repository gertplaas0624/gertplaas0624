- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @gertplaas0624

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in android smartphone lines and scripts, I aim to learn as much as possible using Termux, GitHub and Playstore applications that allow me to use commands and scripts to execute and run DDoS type shell 
     commands and programming type text to perform a variety of different actions that change the services and efficiency levels of different key features I am able to access and use through the vast majority of devices
     and hosts from the internet and other means of connectivity and communication technology that is available around me...

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning some few coding and other skills needed as a basic entry level user, since I've only recently discovered the possibility and usefulness of this unique abilities that the platforms of mobile
     devices are capable of doing, also being able to run a MS-DOS script like program on a mobile device and having seen the vast majority of devices and connectivity types I can access and the array of things I can
     gain access to and fix, correct, achieve and maintain, has awakened something inside me and it thrills me to feel this level of excitement and my enthusiasm grows more as I discover so much more as I progress with my
     passion for this unique project I've come to find myself becoming mesmerised and completely captivated with. 

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on all things that concludes with the above subjects and I am open to discussions, ideas, thoughts and methods. Anyone with more knowledge of Termux and the many useful packages available,
     the types of commands, access points, anything really that pertains to Bluetooth, Wi-fi, 3g, 4g, 5g, Http/s, APN, Dns, Hosts, Operating Systems, Messaging Platforms and so much more than I can even mention right now...
     So if your doing this and are willing to communicate and reach out to me with any feedback, advice, ideas and thoughts.. please do as I am keen on knowledge and i need all the experience and expertise you can possibly
     assist me with, I am looking forward to hearing from you as fellow like-minded individuals, when I master the basics you will find me to be a very exciting, fun seeking individual that loves challenge and push myself to 
     understand the other side of the software that everyone knows so little of and honestly takes for granted while relying merely on the few basic functions they satisfy themselves with becoming used to having available to
     and I simply cannot commit to holding myself back in life and simply letting myself believe that anything in life can only be used for what it's known for simply because people want me to be narrow minded and without 
     ambitions. Nope I like to adventure into the unknown and make it my aspiration to know more and this is what motivates me in life, this is what drives me and moves me to never grow old.
     In this life it's my pleasure to entertain my heart with the technology I believe that is yet to be discovered, and I firmly believe there is another level, another zone of some wave length or signal or almost spiritual
     alike bandwidth that is yet to be accessed via a platform that is yet to be accessed, via electronic technology that will change the entire perception of world and what we believe to exist.
 
- üì´ Anyways if you think I'm worth sharing your friendship with and you know you can guide me with my fundamental hobby of learning Thermal on Android, I'm keen on discovering much more from you.
